# Asteroids

Game build using the Ebiten framework and the Kong package.

## How to build

```bash
go build
```

## How to run

The asteroids game has two commands: run and train, the former runs the game and the latter is used to train a
genetic algorithm to play the game.

You can get more information about the commands by running:
```bash
./asteroids run -h
```

or
```bash
./asteroids train -h
```

The train command generates two outputs, the gene file and the results file. The gene file contains the best
genome found by the genetic algorithm and the results file contains the average fitness of each generation.

In the output directory there are some examples of the outputs generated by the train command. The `output/example.txt`
file was truncated to fit in the repository, the original contained 10000 iterations.

### Examples

```bash
./asteroids train \
  --num-iter=10000 \
  --population-size=2000 \
  --max-asteroids=10 \
  --ticks-limit=5000 \
  --grid-width=4 \
  --grid-height=2 \
  --output-gen=output/example.gen \
  --output-results=output/example.txt 
```

```bash
./asteroids run \
  --max-asteroids=5 \
  --ticks-limit=5000 \
  --grid-width=4 \
  --grid-height=2 \
  --ticks=240 \
  --genome=output/example.gen
```
